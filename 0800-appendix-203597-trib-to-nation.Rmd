## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 65km west of McKenzie, BC, as the crow flies, and is in the Nation River watershed group (Figure \@ref(fig:map-203597)). The crossing is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`m upstream of the stream’s confluence with the Nation River on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` road and is situated under Sekani Forest Products Ltd. road tenure R07214 8.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-203597)).

<br>

This was the first assessment of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, in part because the site is situated on a road identified by BC Timber Sales as a potential deactivation candidate. The stream exhibited high-quality habitat, so a habitat confirmation was completed. Bull trout are documented in the Nation River near the confluence with this stream [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

<br>

<!-- `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. -->

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for the crossing are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-203597).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2025 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-203597)).

<br>

The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-203597-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-203597-d01))."))` The stream had good flow, likely elevated due to significant precipitation the previous night. Abundant gravels were present throughout, and cover was provided by multiple sources including woody debris and undercut banks. No barriers were observed. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` up to the beginning of the wetlands `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-203597-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-203597-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The stream had good flow, although recent rainfall may have influenced discharge. Pockets of gravels were present within the area surveyed. Wetlands adjacent to the channel appeared shallow, suggesting they may freeze to the bottom during winter.

## Environmental DNA Sampling {.unnumbered}

eDNA samples were collected both upstream and downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, with sampling techniques summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tab-edna-203597).

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Ideally, this crossing is deactivated by BC Timber Sales; however, if restoration or maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>


## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was documented as medium value for salmonid spawning and rearing, and the crossing is rated as a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = my_priority, site = my_site)` to be deactivated hopefully by BC Timber Sales.
