## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 50km northeast of Quesnel, BC, in the Willow River watershed group (Figure \@ref(fig:map-196332)). The crossing is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of the stream’s confluence with Yuzkli Creek on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` and is situated under West Fraser Mills Ltd. road tenure R14273 100S.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-196332)).

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was first assessed with a fish passage assessment in 2014 by @hooft2015Fishpassage and ranked as a barrier to fish passage with medium value habitat documented. The crossing was reassessed in 2025 and a habitat confirmation assessment was conducted due to the presence of medium value habitat and bull trout documented just downstream of the crossing in 2014 [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].  

<br>

<!-- `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. -->

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for the crossing are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-196332).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2025 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-196332)). The culvert had a 0.6m outlet drop and a 0.7m deep outlet pool.

<br>

The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-196332-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-196332-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid spawning and rearing. The stream was steep with numerous step-pool features formed by large woody debris ranging from 40–60cm in height. Shallow pools were present, typically 30–40cm deep, with boulder and overhead cover distributed throughout. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

Shallow pools were 30–40cm deep with pockets of gravel suitable for resident bull trout spawning. Large woody debris was abundant throughout.

<br>

## Environmental DNA Sampling {.unnumbered}

eDNA samples were collected both upstream and downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, with sampling techniques summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tab-edna-196332).

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was documented as medium value for salmonid spawning and rearing, and the crossing is rated as a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = my_priority, site = my_site)` priority for replacement due to the large outlet drop and presence of bull trout documented downstream of the crossing.
