## Project Location

The study area includes the FWCP Peace Region with a focus to date on traditional territories of the Tse'khene First Nations.
In `r params$project_year`, field assessments were completed with the `r wsg_names |> knitr::combine_words()` watershed groups (Figure \@ref(fig:overview-map)).  

<br>

In 2019/2020, following a literature review, analysis of fish habitat modelling data, the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS) and a community scoping exercise within the McLeod Lake Indian Band habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 17 sites throughout the Parsnip River watershed with 10 crossings rated as high priorities for rehabilitation and three crossings rated as moderate priorities for restoration. An engineering design for site 125179 on a tributary to the Missinka River was also completed through the 2019/2020 project.  In 2021/2022, project activities reconvened through FWCP directed project PEA-F22-F-3577-DCA. Partners were engaged, funding was raised, planning was conducted and reporting was completed to initiate restoration activities of high priority crossings. Materials were purchased and permitting was put in place to prepare for replacement of the twin culverts on the Missinka River tributary with a clear-span bridge.  In 2025/2026, this collaborative project leveraged ongoing connectivity restoration initiatives in the province and engaged multiple partners to catalyze fish passage restoration activities at high-priority sites identified in from 2019-2024.

## Tse'khene

The Parsnip River watershed is located within the south-eastern portion of the 108,000 km^2^ traditional territory of the Tse'khene from the [McLeod Lake Indian Band](https://www.mlib.ca/about/History). The Tse'khene *"People of the Rocks"* are a south westerly extension of the Athabascan speaking people of northern Canada.  They were nomadic hunters whose language belongs to the Beaver-Sarcee-Tse'khene branch of Athapaskan [@HistoryWhoWeAre2023].  Extensive work is underway to preserve the language with resources such as First Voices available [online](https://www.firstvoices.com/tsekhene-mcleod) and in [app form](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tsekhene-mcleod-lake/id1503929250) for iphone and ipad devices.

<br>

The continental divide separates watersheds flowing north into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River and south and west into the Pacific Ocean via the Fraser River (Figure \@ref(fig:overview-map)). The Parsnip River is a 6th order stream with a watershed that drains an area of 5597km^2^. The mainstem of the river flows within the Rocky Mountain Trench in a north direction into Williston Reservoir starting from the continental divide adjacent to Arctic Lakes. Major tributaries include the Misinchinka, Colbourne, Reynolds, Anzac, Table, Hominka and Missinka sub-basins which drain the western slopes of the Hart Ranges of the Rocky Mountains.  The Parsnip River has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "07EE007")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-hydrology-plot-flow)).

<br>

Construction of the 183m high and 2134m long W.A.C. Bennett Dam was completed in 1967 at Hudson's Hope, BC, creating the Williston Reservoir [@hirst1991Impactsoperations]. Filling of the 375km^2^ reservoir was complete in 1972 and flooded a substantial portion of the Parsnip River and major tributary valleys forming what is now known as the Peace and Parsnip reaches. The replacement of riverine habitat with an inundated reservoir environment resulted in profound changes to the ecology, resource use and human settlement patterns in these systems [@hagen_etal2015Criticalhabitats; @pearce_etal2019FirstNations; @stamford_etal2017FWCPArctic]. Prior to the filling of the reservoir, the Pack River, into which McLeod Lake flows, was a major tributary to the Parsnip River.  The Pack River currently enters the Williston Reservoir directly as the historic location of the confluence of the two rivers lies within the reservoir's footprint.

## Fisheries
Fish species recorded in the BC Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) in the Parsnip River watershed are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:fiss-species-table) [@data_fish_obs]. In addition to flooding related to the formation of the Williston Reservoir, transmission lines, gas pipelines, rail, road networks, forestry, elevated water temperatures, interrupted connectivity, invasion from non-native species and insect infestations affecting forested areas pose threats to fisheries values in the Parsnip River watershed  [@hagen_2015_critical_habs; @stamford_etal2017FWCPArctic; @bull_trout_synthesis; @bt_cosewic]. A brief summary of trends and knowledge status related to Arctic grayling, bull trout, kokanee, mountain whitefish and rainbow trout in Williston Watershed streams is provided in @fishandwildlifecompensationprogram2020PeaceRegion with a more detailed review of the state of knowledge for Parsnip River watershed populations of Arctic grayling and bull trout provided below.

### Bull Trout - sa'ba {-}

Tse'khene Elders from the McLeod Lake Indian Band report that sa'ba (bull trout) size and abundance has decreased in all rivers and tributaries from the reservoir with more injured and diseased fish captured in recent history than was common in the past [@pearce_etal2019FirstNations] . 

<br>

Bull trout populations of the Williston Reservoir watershed are included within the Western Arctic population 'Designatable Unit 10', which, in 2012, received a ranking of ‘Special Concern’ by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada [@cosewic2012COSEWICassessment].  They were added to Schedule 1 under the Species of Risk Act in 2019  [@speciesregistrycanada2020BullTrout] and are also considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially [@bcspeciesecosystemexplorer2020Salvelinusconfluentus]. Some or all of the long-term foot survey index sections of four Williston Reservoir spawning tributaries (Davis Creek, Misinchinka River, Point Creek, and Scott Creek), have been surveyed within 16 of the 19 years between 2001 and 2019 (16 of 19 in Davis River, 10 years over a 13-year period in the Misinchinka River, 11 years over a 14-year period for Point Creek, and 9 years over an 11-year period for Scott Creek [@hagen_etal2020CriticalSpawning]. 

<br>

A study of bull trout critical habitats in the Parsnip River was conducted in 2014 with the Misinchinka and Anzac systems identified as the most important systems for adfluvial (large bodied) bull trout spawners.  The Table River was also highlighted as an important spawning destination.  Other watersheds identified as containing runs of large bodied bull trout spawners included the Colbourne, Reynolds, Hominka and Missinka River with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing each sub-basin [@hagen_etal2015Criticalhabitats].  @hagen_weber2019Limitingfactors have synthesized a large body of information regarding limiting factors, enhancement potential, critical habitats and conservation status for bull trout of the Williston Reservoir and the reader is encouraged to review this work for context.  They have recommended experimental enhancements within a monitoring framework for Williston Reservoir bull trout (some spawning and rearing in Parsnip River mainstem and tributaries) which include stream fertilization, side channel development, riparian restoration and fish access improvement.  

<br>

In 2018, sub-basins of the Anzac River watershed, Homininka River, Missinka River and Table River watersheds were designated as fisheries sensitive watersheds under the authority of the *Forest and Range Practices Act* due to significant downstream fisheries values and significant watershed sensitivity [@anzac_sens; @hominka_sens; @table_sens; @missinka_sens]. Special management is required in these watersheds to protect habitat for fish species including bull trout and Arctic grayling including measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement [@fsw_order].    

<br>

### Arctic Grayling - dusk'ihje{-}

Tse'khene Elders from the McLeod Lake Indian Band report that dusk'ihje (Arctic grayling) numbers have declined dramatically since the flooding of the reservoir and that few dusk'ihje have been caught in the territory in the past 30 years [@pearce_etal2019FirstNations].

<br>

Since impoundment of the Williston Reservoir, it appears that physical habitat and ecological changes have been the most significant factors limiting Arctic grayling productivity. Although these changes are not well understood they have likely resulted in the inundation of key low gradient juvenile rearing and overwintering habitats, isolation of previously connected populations and increases in abundance of predators such as bull trout [@shrimptonj_m__etal2012Geneticanalysis; @hagenTrendAbundanceArctic2018]. Rapid increases in industrial activity and angler access in the Parsnip River watershed pose significant risks to Arctic Grayling productivity with these threats primarily linked to forestry and pipeline initiatives [@hagen_stamford2021ArcticGrayling].

<br>

A detailed review of Arctic grayling life history is available in @stamford_etal2017FWCPArctic. Migration of mature adult Arctic grayling occurs in the spring, typically coinciding with water temperatures of 4$^\circ$C. In the Parsnip watershed, spawning appears to occur between late May and late June, primarily within the lower reaches of the Anzac and Table rivers and the Parsnip River mainstem. Spawning habitat is generally associated with side-channel and multi-channel areas containing small gravels. The current distribution of Williston Arctic grayling is concentrated in fourth-order and larger streams [@williamson_2004; @stamford_etal2017FWCPArctic]. According to @stewartFishLifeHistory2007, Arctic grayling spawn in both large and small tributaries to rivers and lakes, intermittent streams, mainstem rivers, and lakes—most commonly at tributary mouths. Although earlier studies suggest that 0+ grayling overwinter in the lower reaches of larger tributaries (e.g., Table and Anzac rivers) and the Parsnip River, and that few age-1+ grayling have been sampled in tributaries, habitat use in small tributaries and the extent to which they are connected with mainstem habitats across all core areas remains poorly understood. Between 1995 and 2019, population monitoring of Arctic grayling was conducted in the Table River in 9 out of 25 years, and in the Anzac River for 8 years, using snorkel surveys. Results from 2018 and 2019 support efforts to assess the conservation status of the species in the Parsnip Core Area [@hagenTrendAbundanceArctic2018]. Preliminary telemetry data from 2019 indicate that both Arctic grayling and bull trout rely on the Parsnip River mainstem for overwinter residency. Arctic grayling typically begin moving into tributaries in April and are widespread across the watershed by June, with larger adults observed in headwater habitats by August.

<br>

A five-year study on Arctic grayling abundance and trends in the Parsnip River watershed is presented in @hagen_stamford2023ParsnipArctic, which reports that the most productive summer rearing habitats for Arctic grayling are within the Anzac and Table rivers. Although estimated abundance is lower than in the Anzac and Table, productive summer rearing habitats for adult Arctic grayling in the upper Parsnip River watershed are distributed between 36–25km of the Missinka River and 48–32km of the Hominka River. In the Anzac River, @hagen_stamford2021ArcticGrayling report that a 30km stretch from 47km to 16km supports high Arctic grayling abundance and is assumed to provide productive rearing habitat for adults. A chute obstruction located at 47km likely limits further upstream movement. Although the spatial distribution of high Arctic grayling abundance in the Table River has not been delineated through reconnaissance surveys, it has been observed to span at least a 20km zone from the waterfall migration barrier at 37km to 18km.

<br>

Spatial ecology studies in the Parsnip River between 2018 and 2021 has been reported on by @martins_etal2022SpatialEcology with results related to:

- temperature modeling and spatio-temporal patterns in thermal habitat,
- telemetry data modeling and arctic grayling spatial ecology, and
- trophic relationships between Arctic grayling and bull trout

### Fish presence by Habitat Type {-}

A review of available fisheries data for the Parsnip River watershed stratified by different habitat characteristics (stream gradient, channel width, and watershed size) can provide insight into which habitats may provide the highest intrinsic value for fish species based on the number of fish captured in those habitats in past assessment work (Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-grad) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-wshed) and Figures \@ref(fig:fish-plot-grad) - \@ref(fig:fish-plot-wshed)).  It should be noted however that it should not be assumed that all habitat types have been sampled in a non-biased fashion or that particular sites selected do not have a disproportionate influence on the overall dataset composition (ie. fish salvage sites are often located adjacent to construction sites which are more commonly located near lower gradient stream reaches).
