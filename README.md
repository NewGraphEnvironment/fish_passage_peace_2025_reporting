## What this is

The 2025 iteration of the Peace Region fish-passage restoration-planning report. Builds on the 2024 framing with new field data, refined prioritization, a climate-departure appendix grounding the planning horizon in observed climate change, and a standalone executive-summary PDF for partners who need the headline findings without the full report. Source data and methods are open — anyone can rebuild the report from `scripts/run.R`.

## Build

```r
source("scripts/run.R")
```

`scripts/run.R` sources `scripts/staticimports.R` (which inlines helper functions via the [staticimports](https://github.com/wch/staticimports) package) and then runs `bookdown::render_book()`. Bypassing `run.R` gives "undefined function" errors at render time.
