PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 20km northeast of community of McLeod Lake, BC, in the Parsnip River watershed group (Figure \@ref(fig:map-199663)). The crossing is located 780m upstream of the stream’s confluence with the Parsnip River on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` road which is the responsibility of BC Timber Sales.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199663)).

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was first assessed in 2024 as part of this project and was ranked as a barrier to fish passage with medium value habitat documented [@irvine_schick2025RestoringFish]. The crossing was reassessed in 2025, and a habitat confirmation was completed due to the presence of medium value habitat and a significant outlet drop at the culvert. Just upstream of the confluence of this tributary and the Parsnip River, grayling have been documented [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

<br>

<!-- `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. -->

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for the crossing are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-199663).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2025 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199663)). The culvert had a 0.6m outlet drop and a 0.4m deep outlet pool.

<br>

The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

The stream had good flow and abundant gravels for 30–40m downstream of the culvert. A wetland was located ~80m downstream of the FSR. The average channel width was 2.6m and the average wetted width was 2.8m. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.

Wide floodplain within a well defined canyon (approximately 15m deep with slopes of ~45°). Healthy riparian consisting of herb and shrub cover within sparse spruce forest that appears to have been impacted by some sort of beetle or other affliction. Most of the spruce trees were dead with many already fallen down.

## Environmental DNA Sampling {.unnumbered}

eDNA samples were collected both upstream and downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, with sampling techniques summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tab-edna-199663).

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a streambed simulation (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was documented as medium value for salmonid spawning and rearing, and the crossing is rated as a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = my_priority, site = my_site)` priority for replacement due to the large outlet drop.
