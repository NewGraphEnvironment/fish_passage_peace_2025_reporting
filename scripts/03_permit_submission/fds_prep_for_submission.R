# Prepare the Fish Data Submission sheets for the provincial permit submission.
#
# Consumes the four step CSVs produced by 0210_fiss_export_to_template.Rmd and
# 0220_fish_data_tidy.R, applies the submission-only transforms, and writes the
# result to data/permit_submission/. Nothing here touches the workbook - the
# outputs are what gets pasted into a copy of the blank provincial template.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   Rscript scripts/03_permit_submission/fds_prep_for_submission.R
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MANUAL STEPS AROUND THIS SCRIPT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Copy the blank template to data/permit_submission/<permit_id>.xlsx.
#    Blank lives at data/templates/FDS_Template2026-03-11.xlsx.
#
# 2. Fill the Step 1 header block by hand:
#      Project Title              same as the report title
#      Company/Agency             Other
#      Company/Agency (Other)     New Graph Environment Ltd.
#      Spreadsheet Recorder(s)    whoever assembled it
#      Project Type               Research
#      PROVINCIAL PERMIT NUMBER   params$permit_id
#      Reviewed and verified by a Registered Professional Biologist    Yes
#      Biologist's Name           Allan Irvine
#      Registration Number        2775
#      Province of Registration   British Columbia
#
# 3. Run this script, then paste the four CSVs in. Data starts at rows
#    33 / 25 / 20 / 22 for Steps 1-4.
#
#    Step 4 self-populates five AVERAGE() and five VLOOKUP() columns - leave
#    those alone, EXCEPT `Average Gradient (%)`. See the note at the foot of
#    this script.
#
# 4. QA. The provincial QA tool ships in the same zip as the template and runs
#    only on Windows, Excel 2010 or earlier. It is optional but recommended.
#    The historical route is: copy the workbook to OneDrive, open on a Windows
#    machine, run the tool, record issues, copy back. Anything fixed there must
#    be fixed in the repo copy too or the two diverge.
#
# 5. Submit via the WLRS SPO FDS SharePoint site
#    (https://bcgov.sharepoint.com/sites/WLRS-FDS; access via
#    fishdatasub@gov.bc.ca), plus DFO if the permit requires it. Capture the
#    confirmation in the repo.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Replaces fds_prep_for_submission_2023.Rmd. That version also rebuilt watershed
# codes and reference numbers because the 2023 workflow keyed off a hand-filled
# habitat_confirmations.xls; 0205/0210 now produce both upstream, so only the
# submission-shaping transforms remain here. Its per-season values are in git
# history rather than duplicated in a second file - the year in that filename is
# what let it be copied forward into the 2024 and 2025 repos unchanged.

# step_1 - refresh watershed codes, then assign TWCs where none exists ------
#
# Two reasons this happens here rather than in 0205_fiss_wrangle.R:
#
#  - 0205 writes back to the field-form gpkgs with delete_dsn = TRUE, and the
#    `source` column pools all three regions, so running it from one repo
#    destructively rewrites three Mergin projects. Not worth it for a lookup.
#  - The gpkg's watershed data is only as fresh as the last 0205 run. Querying
#    here means the submission always carries current codes.
#
# The template's own rules, from the cell comments on Step 1 (F32 and G32):
#
#   "If there is no Watershed Code results for your waterbody, then leave this
#    field blank and fill out the TWC# field."
#   "For TWCs, leave WSC code and Waterbody ID blank. Do not use the WSC of the
#    parent stream."
#   "identify the waterbody by creating a numeric TWC (maximum 5 digits). All
#    the sites on a waterbody must be given the same #."
#
# "Same waterbody" is keyed on blue_line_key, the FWA stream identifier, so two
# crossings on one stream share a TWC.

# One rule, enforced by `col_skip` below: derived columns are left alone so the
# workbook computes them itself - the VLOOKUP pulls from Step 1 on every sheet,
# Step 2's Soak Time, and all five of Step 4's AVERAGE columns.
#
# That includes `Average Gradient (%)` (Step 4, col 44), whose formula is
# AVERAGE(...)/100. The /100 is correct and must not be overridden: that cell
# carries Excel number format `0.0%`, and a percent-formatted cell multiplies by
# 100 for display. So 0.028 displays as 2.8%, which is what the measurements
# (2.0, 3.5, ...) average to. Writing 2.8 into it would display as 280.0%.
