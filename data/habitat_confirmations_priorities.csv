Tributary to Stony Lake,126158_ds,126158,ds,,2025-10-05T19:18:22Z,AI,240,Medium,High,"Abundant gravels were present throughout with no barriers observed between the road crossing and the lake. The stream was relatively large with good flow, containing occasional shallow pools and sparse large and small woody debris. eDNA sample collected at the downstream end of the survey.",4447,
Tributary to Stony Lake,126158_us,126158,us,,2025-10-05T20:18:22Z,AI,330,Medium,High,"Low-gradient stream with abundant gravels and diverse cover types including boulders, small and large woody debris, and undercut banks.  Good flow with no natural barriers observed within the surveyed area. eDNA sample was collected at the downstream end of the site. Bull trout documented downstream of the crossing in 2014.",4447,
Tributary to Fraser River,196076_ds,196076,ds,,2025-09-25T00:12:36Z,AI,250,Medium,Moderate,"Beaver dams ranging from 0.6–1m in height, began approximately 150m downstream of the culvert within an incised gully. Upstream of the dams, abundant gravels, shallow pools, and small woody debris created habitat suitable for parr and juvenile rearing. eDNA samples collected upstream and downstream of the crossing.",10278,
Tributary to Fraser River,196076_us,196076,us,,2025-09-25T17:09:32Z,AI,700,Medium,Moderate,"Moderate-sized, low-gradient stream with abundant gravels and habitat suitable for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing, including shallow pools, small and large woody debris, and undercut banks. No fish or barriers were observed at the time of assessment. eDNA samples collected upstream and downstream of the crossing.",10278,
Tabor Creek,196085_ds,196085,ds,,2025-09-25T20:11:14Z,AI,350,Medium,Moderate,"The stream was flowing, but discharge appeared minimal relative to channel-forming flows. Extensive algae growth near the highway suggested potential nutrient inputs, possibly from the upstream mill site; algae presence decreased farther downstream. Large areas of gravels were present and suitable for chinook and sockeye spawning, contingent on adequate flows during spawning periods. eDNA sample collected at the downstream end of the survey. Chinook documented downstream of Willow FSR crossing in 2004.",75254,
Tabor Creek,196085_us,196085,us,,2025-09-25T23:11:15Z,AI,410,Medium,Moderate,Channel was dewatered at the time of assessment with shallow pools present at the downstream end of the site. Gravels were abundant throughout and suitable for chinook and sockeye spawning under adequate flow conditions. Deep pools were likely present when the stream was flowing. Chinook were documented downstream of the Willow FSR crossing in 2004.  eDNA sample collected at the bottom end of the survey (upstream of the crossing).,75254,
South Yuzkli Creek,196332_ds,196332,ds,,2025-10-05T23:03:46Z,AI,220,Medium,High,"Steep stream with numerous step-pool features formed by large woody debris ranging from 40–60cm in height. Shallow pools were present, typically 30–40cm deep, with boulder and overhead cover distributed throughout. eDNA sample was collected at the downstream end of the site. Bull trout documented downstream of the crossing in 2014.",2774,
South Yuzkli Creek,196332_us,196332,us,,2025-10-06T00:16:45Z,AI,400,Medium,High,Steep stream with good flow and numerous step-pool features ranging from 30–50cm in height. Shallow pools were 30–40cm deep with pockets of gravel suitable for resident Bull trout spawning. Large woody debris was abundant throughout. eDNA sample was collected at the downstream end of the site.,2774,
Tributary to Fraser River,203581_ds,203581,ds,,2025-09-24T22:27:57Z,AI,80,,Low,Surveyed downstream of railway culvert for ~80m to confluence with the Fraser River. eDNA samples collected upstream of the crossing.,11634,
Tributary to Fraser River,203581_us,203581,us,,2025-09-24T20:58:09Z,AI,650,Medium,Low,Landslide ~300m upstream of railway tracks - Wp208. Low gradient stream with abundant gravels and numerous fish to 60mm observed. Entrenched steep wall valley with several sections where clay banks have collapsed into the stream. Surveyed upstream from railway culvert for 650m.  eDNA samples collected upstream of the crossing.,11634,
Tabor Creek,203582_us,203582,us,,2025-09-26T00:11:35Z,AI,650,Medium,Moderate,"Stream was dewatered until approximately 360m upstream of the railway culverts. The farthest downstream pool contained numerous fry and was where eDNA sampling was conducted. Upstream, occasional pools transitioned to increasing flow toward the upper end of the site where a continually flowing channel reemerged. The system was extremely large with high flows during freshet based on the size of the substrates. Gravels were abundant throughout, with limited woody debris or instream cover at low flow, restricted mainly to interstitial spaces between cobbles and boulders.",74788,
