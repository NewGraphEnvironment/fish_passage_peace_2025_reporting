Tributary to Parsnip River,199663_ds,199663,ds,,2025-09-22T00:40:34Z,AI,80,,Moderate,Wetland located ~80m downstream. Good flow.  Abundant gravels for 30-40m downstream of culvert.  eDNA sample collected.,0,
Tributary to Parsnip River,199663_us,199663,us,,2025-09-22T01:01:53Z,AI,600,Medium,Moderate,"Low gradient stream with significant riparian tree blow down throughout. Very difficult walking so most was done outside of the active channel with spot visits to the stream for measurements/photos completed intermittently for the 600m that was assessed. Wide floodplain within well defined canyon (approximately 15m deep with slopes of ~45°). Healthy riparian, consisting of herb and shrub cover within sparse spruce forest that appears to have been impacted by some sort of beetle or other affliction. Most of the spruce trees were dead with many already fallen down.",0,
Tributary to Nation River,203597_ds,203597,ds,,2025-09-22T20:36:25Z,AI,400,High,High,Very nice stream with good flow. Significant precipitation last night so could be running higher than typical for this time of year. Abundant gravels throughout and abundant cover in numerous forms present. No barriers observed. EDNA sample taken at bottom end of site.,5570,
Tributary to Nation River,203597_us,203597,us,,2025-09-22T22:51:01Z,AI,350,,High,"Surveyed 350m upstream to the beginning of the wetlands. Very nice stream with good flow, although recent rainfall may have had an influence. Pockets of gravels throughout the area surveyed. Although the area viewed was limited, the wetlands appeared shallow so freezing to the bottom may occur during the winter.",5570,
Tributary to Williston Reservoir,203605_ds,203605,ds,,2025-09-23T23:06:20Z,AI,250,High,High,"Surveyed from the Finley FSR downstream to the mapped reservoir location, where the channel retained stream characteristics at the time of assessment. Abundant gravel and cover were present throughout, with numerous run sections providing suitable rearing habitat for juvenile westslope cutthroat trout and rainbow trout. No barriers were observed.  eDNA sample collected.",35932,
Tributary to Williston Reservoir,203605_us,203605,us,,2025-09-23T22:09:05Z,AI,650,High,High,"Large stream with complex habitat and diverse cover including deep pools, boulders, large and small woody debris, and undercut banks. A canyon section approximately 100m long was located 100m upstream of the Modeste FSR bridge, containing multiple cascade steps up to 1m high with deep downstream pools. At the upper end of the site, the channel deflected against steep gully walls. Abundant gravel was present, suitable for adfluvial and resident rainbow trout as well as bull trout. eDNA sample collected.",35932,
