The primary objective of this project is to identify and prioritize fish passage barriers within study areas, develop comprehensive restoration plans to address these barriers, and foster momentum for broader ecosystem restoration initiatives. While the primary focus is on fish passage, this work also serves as a lens through which to view the broader ecosystems, leveraging efforts to build capacity for ecosystem restoration and improving our understanding of watershed health. We recognize that the health of life - such as our own - and the health of our surroundings are interconnected, with our overall well-being dependent on the health of our environment.

<br>

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which
provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing
habitat [@bramblett_etal2002SeasonalUse; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can
present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the
culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road
crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by
ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation
designs.

<br>

Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.
